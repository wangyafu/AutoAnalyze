## Introduction
AutoAnalyze is an AI-powered tool for automated data analysis and processing. Simply provide the path to your data directory and describe your requirements in natural language. The AI will then read files, write Python code, and execute it accordingly. You can monitor the AI's tool usage in real-time.

## Key Features

- Natural language processing for automated Python code generation
- Real-time monitoring of AI tool usage
- Customizable LLM configurations
- Support for image output display

## Installation

```shell
git clone https://github.com/wangyafu/AutoAnalyze
cd AutoAnalyze
```



## Quick Start

This project uses a frontend-backend separation architecture:

- Frontend: Vue.js
- Backend: FastAPI
Ensure you have Node.js and Python environments installed. We use uv for Python dependency management.

### Start Frontend

```shell
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
 ```

### Start Backend

```shell
cd backend
uv sync
uv run app/main.py
 ```

### Register IPython Kernel

To enable image output, real-time code execution monitoring, and code cancellation features (introduced in v0.02), register the IPython kernel:

```shell
# Linux/macOS
source .venv/bin/activate

# Windows
.venv\Scripts\activate.bat  # cmd
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1  # PowerShell

where python # Should include project-specific paths

python -m ipykernel install --user
```

## LLM Configuration

Modify backend/config.json or use the web interface to configure LLM settings. Currently supports OpenAI-compatible APIs with function call capability.

Tested models include qwen-plus.

## Notes

Most code is co-developed with DeepSeek-R1 and Claude. Project logo generated by Gemini 2.0 Flash Experimental. Special thanks to these AI collaborators for accelerating prototype development.
